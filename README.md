# Project 4: Planned Adherence Optimization Using Lean Six Sigma Approach

![](/assets/img/PA.PNG)

## Problem Statement
The planned adherence within the Johannesburg and DBN site of Kansai Plascon was poor and lacked a common measurement tool to account for the complexities within scheduling and planning.

## Task/Action
My role as process engineer was to assist the head of supply chain with streamlining and addressing issues with the entire value chain to effectively identify and mitigate issues with the poor plan adherence. As part of this iniative, I developed a tool to measure planned adherence and schedule adherence separately while also considering batches that were pushed forwards or backwards. The following was done:

>* had a massive brown paper session in both the JHB and DBN sites including all stakeholders across the value chain: manufacturing, filling, maintenance, raw materials, procurement, supply chain, MRP, planning and scheduling and factory technical - this was to identify the current state, brainstorm gaps and develop a future state and develop a plan of action based on findings
>* Worked with team to action plans to improve planned adherence through strategic projects at each department
>* Developed a measuring tool for planned and schedule adherence and benchmarked across both sites - this highlighted a critical finding that schedule adherence was not the issue but rather planned adherence as opposed to prior beliefs
>* Communicated findings to director of operations

Key Implementations:
>* Standardization of planned adherence measure
>* Finite planning (including re-order level management of INT's, MPS with frozen reliable planned elements)
>* Scheduling optimization (backward scheduling, scheduling based on constraints, factoring re-work times, Heijunkai, develop buffer for raws)
>* QC projects (stricter rejection policies, establishment of escalation protocol for long adjustment times, calculation of exact quantity of packaging required, establishing scap rates for adjustment material, different recipe versions on SAP,prediction around first adjustments)
>* Procurement projects (assign packaging to batches and reconcile)
>* Labelling (trigger points for labelling)
>* Inspection of QI system fails
>* Manufacturing issues (improve nossil inefficiencies, improve lead time for grind batches, improve expediting with online tools, reduce expired raws on site, run plant in full auto)
>* Physical validations before sign-off
>* fix of master data to align schedule time with product lead time

# Project 5: Solvent Recycling Plant Optimization

![](/assets/img/Solvent.PNG)

## Problem Statement
The solvent recycling plant at kansai plascon was not producing the desired recovery quality of solvent. This was resulting in more money being spent on buying virgin solvent. In addition to this, operators complained that the fumes released by the system was not in compliance

## Task/Action
My role as process engineer was to investigate and resolve environmental compliance issues as well as improve the efficiency of the system. A mass balance was carried out on the system as well as a kaizen walk. The tool showed that recovery rate was poor because the upstream processes were sending through much more dirtier solvent compared to the past, the settling tanks were not working which means heavier solids were not separated and lastly the handling mechanism for dirty solvent was no longer active. This coupled with the fact that the solvent recyclers were not optimized in terms of settings. 

Key implementations:
> through trials optimum setting were established
> Re-commissioning and maintenance of the settling tanks significantly improved pre-treatment reducing the strain on solvent recycling machines
> Upstream processes were instructed to not use solvent on too many runs of cleaning to reduce the dirtiness of the solvent
> Maintenance assisted with fixing the handling mechanism for the solvent recyclers

## Results
All the above actions were addressed which increased the solvent recovery reclaimation rate by 30%. A future study was then done to utilize unoccupied reactor to carry out solvent recycling which completely eliminated the need for virgin solvent purchasing and drastically reduced the cost of solvent recyling.

# Project 6: Lead Time Reduction Using Lean Six Sigma & Theory of Constraints

![](/assets/img/Cycle2.PNG)

## Problem Statement
Cycle times for the Durban and Johannesburg plants were too high - this was resulting in an increased in backorders and affecting the activity costing model negatively.

## Task/Action
My role as process engineer was to lead a cross functional team (maintenance, production, filling, packaging, raws and procurement) to effectively identify issues with cycle time and reduce this accordingly. By job was also to establish a tracking measure to identify improvement over time. The following was accomplished:

>* Developed the sites first statistical process control model and rolled out in both Johannesburg and Durban sites
>* Developed a annual reporting measure using MES data and carried out monthly reporting and troubleshooting with team to identify and mitigate issues
>* Tracked and worked with team to implement various projects

Example implementations:
>* Implementation of Overall Equipment effectiveness (OEE) in filling hall
>* Carried out a detailed capacity calculation across the manufacturing floor to identify bottleneck streams and re-assign capacity and manpower
>* Implemented a finite capacity scheduling modelling which improved scheduling while controlling cycle time
>* Developed an Excel based heijunkai model that was utilized in conjunction with a packaging supplier for load levelling
>* Optimized fill rates with nossil optimization and best practice maintenance
>* Carried out a finishing tank optimization exercise to reduce head losses and improve filling line hopper filling
>* Developed a pressure drop model which was used in the Johannesburg new automated robotics line
>* Implemented improved campaign scheduling on the shop floor
>* Implemented andon lights to identify when beads need changing as well as various 5s and 7W projects
>* Changed over from pot washing to high pressure cleaning which improved clean pot throughput and improved quality
>* Addressing FTR(first time right) issues
>* Lean six sigma project to reduce extras (which is left over product in the tank which can't be filled due to incorrect labelled packaging being supplied). This enabled a reduction in lead time
>* Carried out a PDCA project on slow resins which were resulting in increased cycle times. Evaluated and identified that the resin was thixotropic and heat sensitive and this was not catered for when it was outsourced. The lack of using a thinning time to warm the product as was done on site when it was internally manufactured resulted in colder months making the product much more viscous and slowing the fill rate. Adjusted specification and adjusted pump pressure to cater for the increased head losses. Lab experiments were also done to prove the dependency on temperature. 


## Results
Managed to reach a 10% reduction in average cycle times across the Johannesburg and Durban sites.

# Project 10: Linear Programming Model to Optimize product mix

![](/assets/img/Linear.PNG)

## Problem Statement
The Kansai Plascon group was under pressure to reduce cost and improve efficiencies. One such path to that was optimizing product mix to achieve maximum profit.

## Task/Action
I explored the option of developing a linear programming model within a pilot area (Lean GP section). A model objective function was developed to maximize profit based on all products in the lean GP section. The model was constrained by several factors:
>* Capacity constraints
>* Demand constraints
>* Cost/L constraints
>* Manpower constraints

## Result
The exercise was successful in indicating the optimum product mix to achieve the highest cost, however due to customer requirements it was not practical to implement the model results, as the model indicated a higher sales of a product that usually has a lower demand yet higher sale price. The results did however give further insight into SKU rationalization as a potential future activity within the business.

# Project 10: Product Costing Model Update

![](/assets/img/Activity.PNG)

## Problem Statement
The Kansai Plascon group had issues with the costing model. 1) The recipe hours were not a true reflection of the physical process. Cost recoveries were low and understated the COGS value of products.

## Task/Action
Investigate and implemented ways to improve the model. Initially manufacturing overheads was caculated using a fixed dwell time based on the machine hours. So the fixed, variable and labor hours were the same. This was redefined:

Fixed hours: usable machine capacity constrained by bottleneck
Labor hours: no. of operators * hours per month * efficiency factor
variable hours: budget hours based on forecast requirements

Recipe hours were split into fixed, labor and variable as opposed to a single dwell time value
Activity rate can be calcualted for each category of fixed, labor and variable costs which is a better indicator of efficiency and improves costing estimation

## Result
40-60 % accuracy improvement in model i.e. reduction in under recoveries value.

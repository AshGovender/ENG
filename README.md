## Problem Statement
There was huge losses in solvent that could not be accounted for. As a result, all avenues of solvent loss needed to be catered for. Solvent losses are possible through open tanks and could have possibly been contributing to the variance identified.

## Action
I calculated losses through the solvent tanks using python to carry out the calculations.

## Data sources
Plant data such as tank dimensions, thicknesses and design factors were obtained from the maintenance department. Other unknown coeffiecients and factors were estimated using theoretical data obtained online and engineering judegment played a big role.

## Results 
The caculations showed negligible losses of solvent from the tanks, hence we could rule this out as a potential issue for the solvent losses. After re-looking at the process we found that losses were attributed to calibration issues during PLC loading of solvent.

## Python libraries
Matplotlib

## Data science tool
None

In this project I used a DMAIC approach together with data science tools to process data and come up with a reason for the poor stock health
